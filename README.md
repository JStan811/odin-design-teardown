# odin-design-teardown

The Design Teardown project is from [Odin's HTML & CSS curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-teardown) - 

"In this simple project, you’ll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now – Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training yourself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

Your job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy."
